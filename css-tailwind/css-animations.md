# CSS Animations
## Two Ways
### 1. Transitions
### 2. Animations

## 1. Transitions

- Transitions wait until the change in a property occurs and then allows changes to take place over time.
- Without a transition any changes in a property will take effect immediately.
- Transitions should be used when properties are changed interactively
	- Ex: Hovering and Focusing

## 2. Animations
- Animations however provide keyframes for more control over the animation and allows us to create complex animations on a frame by frame basis.
- Use animations when you want to create complex animations that just work without having to wait for properties that change interactively.
- We can create stunning animations by combining both transitions and animations together.

## Transitions in Detail
- To create a transition, we first need a component that has change in property.
