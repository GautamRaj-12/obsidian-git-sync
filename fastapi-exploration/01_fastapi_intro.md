# FastAPI Course Overview

## Introduction to FastAPI
- **FastAPI**: A super-fast, modern Python web framework.
- **Comparison**: Other frameworks include Django and Flask, but FastAPI is more modern and supports asynchronous programming, which Django lacks.

## Key Features of FastAPI

### 1. Automatic Documentation
- **Swagger UI**: Built-in UI to view and test API routes/endpoints.
- **ReDoc UI**: An alternative UI with a minimalistic design.
- **Benefit**: Eliminates the need for tools like Postman to test APIs.

### 2. Modern Python Features
- **Python 3.6+**: FastAPI leverages modern Python features.
- **Pydantic**: Provides a strong typing system with type hints for variables (e.g., `user_id: str`, `id: int`).
- **Benefit**: Ensures clarity and reduces errors in code.

### 3. OpenAPI and JSON Schema
- **OpenAPI**: FastAPI is based on OpenAPI standards, ensuring your API is standardized.
- **JSON Schema**: FastAPI returns responses in JSON format by default.
- **Benefit**: Facilitates seamless communication with other systems.

### 4. Code Editor Autocomplete
- **IDEs Supported**: VS Code, PyCharm.
- **Benefit**: FastAPI’s use of Pydantic ensures robust autocomplete functionality in supported IDEs.

### 5. Security and Standards
- **HTTP Basic Security**: Includes OAuth2 with JWT tokens.
- **Token Handling**: Supports API tokens via headers, queries, cookies, etc.
- **Benefit**: Simplifies implementing secure authentication.

### 6. Dependency Injection and Plugins
- **Dependency Injection**: Supports unlimited plugins for extending functionality.
- **Testing**: Built-in testing capabilities using PyTest.
- **Benefit**: Simplifies the development and testing process.

### 7. Starlette Integration
- **Starlette**: FastAPI is built on Starlette, providing:
  - WebSocket support
  - GraphQL support
  - Background tasks
  - Startup and shutdown events
- **Benefit**: Expands FastAPI’s functionality, making it a full-featured web framework.

### 8. Database Support
- **SQL Databases**: FastAPI supports SQL databases.
- **NoSQL Databases**: Also supported for flexibility in database choices.
- **GraphQL**: Supported for building APIs with GraphQL.
- **Benefit**: Provides versatility in data handling.

## Course Outline

### 1. Getting Started
- **Setup**: How to install and set up FastAPI.
- **Basic Structure**: Understanding FastAPI's basic structure.

### 2. Basic Concepts
- **Path Parameters**: How to use path parameters in FastAPI.
- **API Documentation**: Using Swagger and ReDoc for documenting APIs.
- **Query Parameters**: How to work with query parameters and request queries.

### 3. Intermediate Concepts
- **Debugging**: Techniques for debugging FastAPI applications.
- **Pydantic Schemas**: Understanding and using Pydantic schemas.
- **SQLAlchemy**: Connecting to databases using SQLAlchemy.
  - **Models**: Creating models and tables using SQLAlchemy.

### 4. Database Tasks
- **CRUD Operations**: Implementing Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for a blog.
- **Responses**: Handling exceptions and defining response models.
  - **Response Model**: Limiting fields in the response (e.g., hiding user passwords).

### 5. User Management
- **User Creation**: Steps to create users.
- **Password Hashing**: Hashing passwords using secure algorithms.
- **Documentation Tags**: Organizing and tagging documentation.

### 6. Relationships
- **SQLAlchemy Relationships**: Creating and managing relationships between models (e.g., blog and user).
- **Two-Way Relationships**: Implementing bidirectional relationships.

### 7. Refactoring for Large Applications
- **Initial Development**: Starting with a basic, unstructured application.
- **Refactoring**: Organizing the application into routers and structured modules.

### 8. Authentication with JWT
- **JWT (JSON Web Token)**: Implementing authentication using JWT.
- **Login Route**: Creating a login route to verify credentials.
- **JWT Integration**: Protecting routes with JWT-based authentication.

### 9. Deployment
- **Deployment**: Steps to deploy the FastAPI application using [Deta.sh](https://www.deta.sh/).
