## Process
- ***Definition***:A program in execution.
- ***Context Switching***: It is a process that involves switching of the CPU from one process or task to another. In this, the execution of the process that is present in the running state is suspended by the kernel and another process that is present in the ready state is executed by the CPU.The processes are switched so fast that it gives an illusion that all the processes are being executed at the same time.
	- So, Takes more time in case of process
- ***Inter Process Communication***: Takes more time
- ***Address Space***: Different Address Space
- ***Dependency***: 
## Thread
- It is a sub part of process.
- ***Context Switching***: Takes Less time
- ***Inter Thread Communication***: Takes less time
- ***Address Space***: Share same Address Space
