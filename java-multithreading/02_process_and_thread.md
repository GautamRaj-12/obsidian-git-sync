| **Definition**           | A program in execution.                                                                                                                   | It is a sub part of a process.                         |
| **Context Switching**    | Involves switching the CPU from one process to another, taking more time as the kernel suspends the running process and executes another. | Takes less time compared to process context switching. |
| **Inter Communication**  | **Inter Process Communication**: Takes more time                                                                                          | **Inter Thread Communication**: Takes less time        |
| **Address Space**        | Different Address Space                                                                                                                   | Share the same Address Space                           |
| **Dependency**           | Not dependent on each other                                                                                                               | Dependent on each other                                |
| **Synchronization**      | Do not require synchronization                                                                                                            | May require synchronization                            |
| **Resource Consumption** | More                                                                                                                                      | Less                                                   |
| **Time for creation**    | More                                                                                                                                      | Less                                                   |
| **Time for termination** | More                                                                                                                                      | Less                                                   |
