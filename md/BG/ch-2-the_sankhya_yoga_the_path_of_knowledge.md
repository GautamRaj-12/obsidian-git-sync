# Chapter 2 - Sankhya Yoga – The Path of Knowledge

- **Arjuna's Despondency:**
  - Krishna observes Arjuna overwhelmed with compassion, sorrow, and tears.
  - Krishna consoles Arjuna by reminding him of his reputation as a noble and fearless warrior.
  - Krishna warns Arjuna that if he refuses to fight, he will lose respect and be seen as a coward.

- **Arjuna's Moral Dilemma:**
  - Arjuna argues that he cannot live with himself if he kills his teachers and cousins.
  - He would rather live as a beggar than kill his revered teachers and stain life's pleasures with their blood.
  - Arjuna seeks Krishna’s guidance on how to proceed.

- **Krishna’s Teachings on the Atman:**
  - **The Soul's Eternity:**
    - Krishna explains that the wise grieve neither for the dead nor the living.
    - The soul (Atman) is eternal; it was never born and will never die.
    - Death pertains only to the body, not the soul.
    - Just as a person discards old clothes and puts on new ones, the soul takes on a new body after death.
    - The Atman is imperishable, unborn, eternal, ever-enduring, and changeless.

  - **Dealing with External Factors:**
    - Krishna advises Arjuna not to be anxious about the armies; the Spirit within is imperishable.
    - External factors like cold and heat, pain and happiness, come and go; they are temporary.
    - Krishna encourages Arjuna to endure these external factors bravely.
  
  - **Svadharma (Duty):**
    - One’s duty (Svadharma) is the highest service to the Atman or true self.
    - For a warrior like Arjuna, the duty to fight against evil, greed, cruelty, and jealousy is paramount.
    - Krishna urges Arjuna not to shy away from his duty.

- **Introduction to Karma Yoga:**
  - Krishna promises to explain Karma Yoga, a practical method to break the bondage of all action.
  - On this path, effort is never wasted, and even a little practice protects one from the cycle of death and rebirth.
  - **Key Principle:** One has the right to work or action in this world, but should not be attached to the fruits of their labor.
  - The outcomes of actions are inevitable, but attachment to these rewards should be avoided.
  - **Pure Intellect:** Sages guided by pure intellect renounce attachment to the fruits of action and reach the highest bliss.

- **Recognition of the Saint:**
  - Arjuna asks how to recognize a saint who has attained Pure Intellect and reached the state of Bliss.
  - **Krishna’s Response:**
    - A person who has given up the desires of their heart and is satisfied with the Self alone has reached the highest state.
    - The sage who is unruffled in suffering, not roused by enjoyment, and free from attachment, anger, or fear stands at a lofty level.
    - One who is unattached to people and places, accepts good and evil alike, and is neither welcoming nor repulsed by them is merged in the Infinite.
    - A person who can withdraw their senses from the attraction of objects, like a tortoise withdraws its limbs, has attained Perfection.

  - **Conquering the Senses:**
    - Krishna emphasizes the importance of meditating steadfastly on the Divine and conquering the senses to achieve perfection.
    - When a person dwells on sense objects, they develop attraction, which leads to desire, anger, delusion, loss of reason, and ultimately destruction.
    - The self-controlled soul who moves among sense objects without attachment or repulsion attains eternal Peace.
    - Peace leads to freedom from misery and right action.

- **Importance of Concentration and Meditation:**
  - Right action is impossible without concentration, and concentration is impossible without meditation.
  - Without meditation, one cannot expect peace, and without peace, happiness is unattainable.
  - Krishna advises Arjuna to keep his senses detached from their objects to purify his mind.

- **The State of the Self:**
  - The saint is awake when the world sleeps and ignores worldly desires.
  - Attaining the state of the Supreme Spirit (the Self) leads to union with the Eternal.
  - The true goal of life is to merge with Divine Consciousness.
