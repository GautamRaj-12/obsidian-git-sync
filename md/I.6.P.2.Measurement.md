# Measurement of Physical Quantities and Units

## Physical Quantities

A **physical quantity** is a characteristic or property of an object that can be measured or quantified. Physical quantities are broadly classified into two types:
- **Fundamental or Basic Physical Quantities**
- **Derived Physical Quantities**

### Fundamental or Basic Physical Quantities
These are quantities that do not depend on other quantities. There are seven fundamental quantities:
- **Length** (metre, m)
- **Mass** (kilogram, kg)
- **Time** (second, s)
- **Temperature** (kelvin, K)
- **Electric Current** (ampere, A)
- **Luminous Intensity** (candela, cd)
- **Amount of Substance** (mole, mol)

### Derived Physical Quantities
These quantities are derived from the fundamental quantities. Examples include:
- **Area** (square metre, m²)
- **Volume** (cubic metre, m³)
- **Speed** (metre per second, m/s)

## Units

A **unit** is a standard quantity used to specify measurements. 

### Systems of Units
There are various systems of units that have been used historically:
- **FPS System** (Foot-Pound-Second)
- **CGS System** (Centimetre-Gram-Second)
- **MKS System** (Metre-Kilogram-Second)
- **SI System** (International System of Units)

### Non-standard and Standard Units
- **Non-standard units** were based on body parts or natural objects (e.g., hand span, cubit, foot span).
- **Standard units** have fixed values and are universally accepted. The SI system is the most widely used standard system today.

### SI Units
The SI system uses standard units for measurement. Four basic physical quantities in the SI system are:
- **Length**: metre (m)
- **Mass**: kilogram (kg)
- **Time**: second (s)
- **Temperature**: kelvin (K)

### Other Systems of Units
- **FPS System**: foot (ft), pound (lb), second (s)
- **CGS System**: centimetre (cm), gram (g), second (s)
- **MKS System**: metre (m), kilogram (kg), second (s)

### Multiples and Submultiples of Units
SI units can be too large or too small for practical use, so multiples and submultiples are used. These are indicated by prefixes (e.g., kilo, centi, milli).

### Writing Units Correctly
- Symbols for units are usually in small letters (e.g., m for metre, g for gram).
- Prefixes for multiples and submultiples are also in small letters (e.g., km for kilometre).
- Units derived from scientists' names are written with a capital letter (e.g., K for kelvin).
- Symbols do not follow plural forms or full stops (e.g., 5 kg, not 5kgs or 5kg.).
- There should be no space between the prefix and the unit (e.g., mg, not m g).

## Measurement of Length and Area

### Measurement of Length
**Length** is the distance between two points and can be measured using devices like rulers and measuring tapes.

### Units of Length
- **SI Unit**: metre (m)
- **Common Multiples and Submultiples**: millimetre (mm), centimetre (cm), kilometre (km)

#### Example Conversions
- 1 km = 1000 m
- 1 cm = 0.01 m
- 1 mm = 0.001 m

### Measurement Devices
- **Ruler**: Commonly used for small lengths.
- **Measuring Tape**: Used for larger and curved lengths.

### Measurement of Area
**Area** is the amount of surface a plane figure occupies.

#### Units of Area
- **SI Unit**: square metre (m²)
- Other units: square centimetre (cm²), hectare (ha), square kilometre (km²)

#### Example Conversion
- 1 cm² = 0.0001 m²

#### Measurement Devices
- **Graph Paper**: Used to measure the area of irregular shapes.

## Measurement of Mass, Time, and Temperature

### Measurement of Mass
**Mass** is the amount of matter in an object.

#### Units of Mass
- **SI Unit**: kilogram (kg)
- Common multiples and submultiples: gram (g), milligram (mg)

#### Example Conversion
- 1 kg = 1000 g
- 1 g = 0.001 kg

#### Measurement Devices
- **Beam Balance**: Compares the mass of an object with standard weights.
- **Electronic Balance**: Measures mass electronically.

### Measurement of Time
**Time** is the progression of events from the past to the future.

#### Units of Time
- **SI Unit**: second (s)
- Other units: minute (min), hour (h), day

#### Example Conversion
- 1 minute = 60 seconds
- 1 hour = 3600 seconds

### Measurement of Temperature
**Temperature** is the degree of hotness or coldness of an object.

#### Units of Temperature
- **SI Unit**: kelvin (K)
- Other units: degree Celsius (°C)

## Career in Measurement: Metrologist

A **Metrologist** works with instruments for measurement. They design, adjust, and maintain these instruments and conduct research on measurement principles. They collaborate with scientists across various fields to develop devices and standards used in measurements.
