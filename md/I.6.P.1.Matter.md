# Characteristics of Matter

## Main Characteristics
- **It has mass.**
- **It occupies space.**

### Matter Has Mass
- The amount of matter contained in an object is called its mass.
- The 'heaviness' of an object depends on its mass.
- 'Heavy' and 'light' refer to weight, which is the force exerted by an object.
- Mass cannot be measured directly; it is related to weight.
- **Activity 1.1: To show that matter has mass**
  - **Materials required:** electronic balance, glass, water
  - **Method:**
    1. Ensure the balance reading is 0.
    2. Place an empty glass on it.
    3. Pour water into the glass carefully.
  - **Observations and conclusions:**
    - The glass and water are both made of matter.
    - The reading on the balance increases with the glass and water, showing that matter has mass.

### Matter Occupies Space
- **Activity 1.2: To show that matter occupies space**
  - **Materials required:** graduated jar, stone, string, water
  - **Method:**
    1. Fill the jar with water up to the 50 mL mark.
    2. Tie the stone to the string and dip it in the water until it is submerged.
    3. Observe the water level change.
    4. Remove the stone and observe the water level.
  - **Observations and conclusions:**
    - The water level increases when the stone is submerged because the stone takes up space.
    - When the stone is removed, the water fills the previously occupied space.
    - This shows that matter occupies space.

## Composition of Matter
- The basic unit of matter is the atom.
- Most atoms do not exist independently; they join together to form molecules.
- A molecule is the smallest particle of matter capable of independent existence, consisting of one or more atoms.
  - Example: Two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom form a water molecule.

### Historical Perspectives
- Ancient Indian philosophers described matter as made of five elements: earth, sky, air, fire, and water.
- Maharishi Kanada mentioned matter as made of tiny particles called 'anu' and 'paramanu'.
- Democritus proposed matter is made up of indivisible particles called 'atomon'.
- John Dalton developed the modern concept of the atom.

## Characteristics of Molecules
- Molecules are very small and cannot be seen under a microscope.
- Molecules in all forms of matter are not at rest; they either vibrate (solids) or move randomly (liquids and gases).
- Molecules are held together by intermolecular force of attraction.

### Intermolecular Space
- **Activity 1.3: To observe the intermolecular space in water**
  - **Materials required:** graduated beaker, teaspoon, sugar, water
  - **Method:**
    1. Pour water in the beaker up to the 50 mL mark.
    2. Add two teaspoons of sugar and stir until dissolved.
  - **Observations and conclusions:**
    - The water level does not rise because sugar molecules occupy the intermolecular spaces between water molecules.

## States of Matter
- Matter exists in three states: solid, liquid, and gas.
- Water can exist in all three states: ice (solid), water (liquid), and steam (gas).

### Arrangement of Molecules
- **Solids:**
  - Strong intermolecular force, molecules closely packed.
  - Molecules vibrate in fixed positions.
- **Liquids:**
  - Weaker intermolecular force, molecules loosely packed.
  - Molecules slide over each other and move randomly.
- **Gases:**
  - Negligible intermolecular force, molecules very loosely packed.
  - Molecules move freely and occupy all available space.

## Properties of Solids
- Definite shape and volume.
- Rigid and usually incompressible.
- Do not flow easily.
- Expand slightly on heating.
- Can have multiple free surfaces.

## Properties of Liquids
- Definite volume but no definite shape.
- Not rigid and nearly incompressible.
- Flow easily.
- Expand more than solids on heating.
- Have one free surface.

### Surface Tension
- The free surface of a liquid acts like a stretched elastic membrane, allowing insects to move on water.

## Properties of Gases
- No definite shape or volume.
- Highly compressible.
- Not rigid and flow easily.
- Expand greatly on heating.
- No free surface.

## Change of State
- Matter can change state by heating or cooling.
- **Melting:** Solid to liquid at the melting point.
- **Boiling:** Liquid to gas at the boiling point.
- **Evaporation:** Molecules escape from the liquid surface at temperatures below the boiling point.
- **Condensation:** Gas to liquid at the condensation point.
- **Freezing:** Liquid to solid at the freezing point.

### Example
- Ice melts at 0°C (melting/freezing point).
- Water boils at 100°C (boiling/condensation point).
