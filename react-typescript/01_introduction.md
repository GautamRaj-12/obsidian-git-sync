# Why typescript + react?
- With static type checking, we get to learn about potential bugs as we are typing the code, than heading to the browser and figuring out at runtime.
- Provides a way to describe the shape of an object hence providing better documentation and autocomplete.
- Makes maintenance and refactoring of large code bases much easier.

## Add typescript to existing CRA project
