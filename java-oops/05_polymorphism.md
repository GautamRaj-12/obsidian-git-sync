## What is Polymorphism?
- Poly means many, morphism means forms

## Types of Polymorphism

### Compile Time Polymorphism(Static Polymorphism)
- To achieve it we use: ***METHOD OVERLOADING***
- It is handled by compiler.
### Run Time Polymorphism(Dynamic Polymorphism)
- To achieve it we use: ***METHOD OVERRIDING***
- It is handled by JVM.

## Method Overloading
- Multiple methods with same name.
- Both methods in same class.
- Different Arguments (Any of the following)
	- Numbers
	- Sequence
	- Type of Arguments
## Method Overriding
- Multiple methods with same name.
- Both methods in same class.
- Same Arguments (Any of the following)
	- Numbers
	- Sequence
	- Type of Arguments
## Important Questions
- **Can we achieve method overloading by changing the return type of method only?**
