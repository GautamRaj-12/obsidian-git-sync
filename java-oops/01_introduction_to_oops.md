## Introduction
- OOPs mean Object Oriented Programming System/Structure.
- It is a programming paradigm or methodology.
	- **Paradigm**
- Here Object means real world entity like Car, Bike, ATM etc.
- Every real world entity has: properties and behavior(functionality)
## Procedural Programming vs OOPS
### Procedural Programming
1. Programming is divided into parts called functions.
2. Does not provide a proper way to hide data, gives importance to function and data moves freely.
3. Overloading is not possible
4. Inheritance is not possible
5. Code re-usability is not present
6. Ex: Pascal, C, Fortran
### OOPS
1. Program is divided into Objects.
2. Objects provide data hiding, gives importance to data.
3. Overloading is Possible.
4. Inheritance is Possible.
5. Code re-usability is present.
6. Ex: Java, C#, Python, C++ etc.
