## Procedure
1. Join the discord server
2. Follow rules to get verified
3. After that you will be able to see `forum-discussion` channel.
4. In that channel read "How to start as a developer"
5. Complete **Lift Simulation** task within 31 Days
	1. [lift simulation repo](https://github.com/Real-Dev-Squad/Lift-**Simulation**)
	2. Not all the requirements are listed here, so attempt it , go to `lift-simulation` channel and get it recursively verified by peers.
	3. Once peers have verified, get it verified by members.
	4. If you feel stuck, make friends, join in calls to discuss and get your doubts cleared.
	5. Ankush regularly joins calls, it is highly advisable to join in the calls, communicate properly with Ankush, regarding doubts or updates.
	6. After you get verified by the members, you are ready for the next step.
	7. Remember communication is key, if for some reason, you won't be able to complete the task on time beforehand. Don't randomly come on the 25th day and say, Can you extend.
		1. If you don't know anything, then communicate everyday that today i studied this to achieve this in the task.(ex studied css animations to add animations to the lift etc.)
		2. If you have exams or health issues, please communicate before hand, that you will be having exams so you will be working on it after some days.
		3. If you don't communicate like this, you won't be getting any extensions.


6. The next step is to go to `i-am-idle` channel and request Ankush to give you a task. For requesting task you need to follow a definite formatting, which you can find in pinned messages.
