## First Step

1. **Join the Discord Server**

2. **Follow Rules to Get Verified**
	-  Adhere to the server rules and complete the verification process.

3. **Access the `forum-discussion` Channel**
	- Once verified, you will have access to the `forum-discussion` channel.

4. **Read the "How to Start as a Developer" Guide**
	- Locate and read the guide titled "How to Start as a Developer" in the `forum-discussion` channel.

5. **Complete the **Lift Simulation** Task Within 31 Days**
	   1. Review the [Lift Simulation Repository](https://github.com/Real-Dev-Squad/Lift-Simulation).\
	   2. Note that not all requirements are listed in the repo. Attempt the task, and get it verified recursively by peers in the `lift-simulation` channel.
	   3. Once peer verification is complete, seek verification from members.
	   4. If you encounter difficulties, engage with others, join calls for discussions, and clarify doubts.
	   5. ***Ankush*** frequently participates in calls. It is highly recommended to join these calls and communicate your doubts or updates directly with Ankush.
	   6. After receiving member verification, you will be ready for the next step.

6. **Communication is Key**
	- If you anticipate any delays or issues,  communicate in advance rather than requesting extensions at the last moment. It is fine to not know anything but you should be willing to take ownership and learn
	     1. Update your progress regularly, e.g., "Today, I studied CSS animations to implement them in the lift."
	     2. If you have exams or health concerns, inform us beforehand so we understand your situation.
	     3. Failure to communicate in advance may result in the denial of extension requests.
