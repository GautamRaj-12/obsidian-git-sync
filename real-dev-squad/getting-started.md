## First Step : Onboarding

1. **Join the Discord Server**
	- Use the invite link provided to join our community.

2. **Follow Rules to Get Verified**
	-  Adhere to the server rules and complete the verification process.

3. **Access the `forum-discussion` Channel**
	- Once verified, you will have access to the `forum-discussion` channel.

4. **Read the "How to Start as a Developer" Guide**
	- Locate and read the guide titled "How to Start as a Developer" in the `forum-discussion` channel.

5. **Complete the **Lift Simulation** Task Within 31 Days**
	   1. Review the [Lift Simulation Repository](https://github.com/Real-Dev-Squad/Lift-Simulation).\
	   2. Note that not all requirements are listed in the repo. Attempt the task, and get it verified recursively by peers in the `lift-simulation` channel.
	   3. Once peer verification is complete, seek verification from members.
	   4. If you encounter difficulties, engage with others, join calls for discussions, and clarify doubts.
	   5. ***Ankush*** frequently participates in calls. It is highly recommended to join these calls and communicate your doubts or updates directly with Ankush.
	   6. After receiving member verification, you will be ready for the next step.

6. **Communication is Key**
	- If you anticipate any delays or issues,  communicate in advance rather than requesting extensions at the last moment. It’s okay if you don’t know everything initially; what matters is your willingness to take ownership and learn.
	     1. Update your progress regularly, e.g., "Today, I studied CSS animations to implement them in the lift."
	     2. If you have exams or health concerns, inform us beforehand so we understand your situation.
	     3. Failure to communicate in advance may result in the denial of extension requests.

## Second Step : Requesting a Task

- **Request a Task After Completing the Lift Simulation**
	  - Once you have finished the Lift Simulation, navigate to the `i-am-idle` channel and request a new task from ***Ankush***.

- **Follow Proper Formatting for Requests**
	- Ensure that you request a task using the correct formatting. You can find the required formatting in the pinned message within the `i-am-idle` channel.

- **Send Gentle Reminders if Needed**
	- If you do not receive a task promptly, send gentle reminders to Ankush.

- **Bonus Tip: Join Calls for Faster Task Allocation**
	- Participating in calls can help you get assigned tasks more quickly.

- **One More Way: Identify and Report Issues or Bugs** 
	-  Look for issues or bugs and report them to Ankush to receive a task.

## Third Step : 
Upon your request, Ankush will decide whether to assign you a task. If the GitHub issue for the task is already created, proceed to create a TCR (Task Creation Request). If not,first create an issue then create the TCR first and then seek approval from Ankush. Once approved, start working on the task.

1. **Create a TCR(Task creation request)**
    - Visit the [Status Page](https://status.realdevsquad.com/issues).
    - Click on the 'Issues' tab and paste the GitHub issue title, then press 'Submit'.
    - On the Status Page, click 'Request as Task'.
    - Set a reasonable time limit for task completion, the time you will need to get your code to **production**. Once again, the time you entering here will be the time in which your code is in the **production** and ready to use(not any intermediary state).
    - After submitting, you will be redirected to a dashboard.
2. **Copy Dashboard URL and Tag for Approval:**
	- Copy the dashboard URL.    
	- Tag Ankush requesting approval using channels `new-tasks` or `i-am-idle` on discord.    
	- And ask him to approve.
1. **Work on Approved Task:**
    
    - After Ankush's approval, start working on the assigned task.
2. **Seek Clarification When Needed:**
    
    - If you face difficulties, discuss them with Ankush, Application Owner, or Feature Owner.
    - Ensure alignment and correctness of your work.
3. **Resolve Doubts:**
    
    - If you have doubts, feel free to ask questions in the server's respective channel.
    - For specific technical doubts, ping Tejas or Prakash.
    - For doubts related to business logic, ping Ankush.
