## Terms
- **STRONGLY TYPED LANGUAGES**
	- Demand the specification of types.
	- TS is a strongly typed language, where we specify the types of data that we are using.
- **LOOSELY TYPED LANGUAGES**
	- Do not require type specification.
	- JS is a loosely/weakly typed language.
- These relates to **STATIC TYPING** and **DYNAMIC TYPING** but both are not same.
- *A language that is strongly typed can be either statically or dynamically typed.*
- **STATIC TYPING**
	- TS is a statically typed language. **That means types are checked at compile time.**
- **DYNAMIC TYPING**
	- JS is a dynamically typed language. **That means types are checked at run time.**

## Benefits of TS
- Self documenting code
- Catch errors in development
- Great For Teams

### Inference
- TypeScript type _inference_ is _a feature that allows the TypeScript compiler to automatically deduce the type of a variable or expression_.
- When we write the following code:
```js
let lastName = "Raj"
```
- It is a simple JS code, but when we hover over it, we see the following:
